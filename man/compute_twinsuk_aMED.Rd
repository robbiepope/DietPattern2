\arguments{
\item{est.intakes}{Pre-processed TwinsUK estimated intake .csv file (grams per day).
the first column should be the unique identifier for each questionnaire.}

\item{nutr.intakes}{Pre-processed TwinsUK estimated nutrient intakes .csv file,
the first column should be the unique identifier for each questionnaire.}

\item{merge_col_name_est.intakes}{name of column to merge estimated food and 
nutrient intakes for food grams per day .csv file. Default is 'FFQ_ID'.}

\item{merge_col_name_nutr.intakes}{name of column to merge estimated food and 
nutrient intakes for nutrient .csv file. Default is 'FFQ_ID'.
the first column should be the unique identifier for each questionnaire.}

\item{sex_col}{Name of the column containing sex information in \code{est.intakes} (default: 'Sex').}

\item{female_alcohol}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the lower and upper alcohol intake limits for females (default: c(5, 15) g/day).}

\item{male_alcohol}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the lower and upper alcohol intake limits for males (default: c(5, 25) g/day).}

\item{return_medians}{Logical, whether to return population medians along with final aMED scores (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
If \code{return_medians = TRUE}, a named list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{df_scores}{Data frame of final aMED scores and estimated intakes for each individual.}
    \item{df_medians}{Data frame of population medians for each aMED component.}
  }
  If \code{return_medians = FALSE}, a single data frame of final aMED scores and estimated intakes.
}
\description{
The compute_twinsuk_aMED function is a wrapper of calculate_aMED to compute the 
aMED diet score using TwinsUK specific parameters and food groupings.
aMED computation as described by Fung et al. (2005).
TwinsUK specific FFQ line item & nutrient components as described by Asnicar et al. (2021).
