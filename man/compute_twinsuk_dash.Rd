)
}
\arguments{
\item{est.intakes}{Pre-processed TwinsUK estimated intake .csv file (grams per day).
the first column should be the unique identifier for each questionnaire.}

\item{nutr.intakes}{Pre-processed TwinsUK estimated nutrient intakes .csv file,
the first column should be the unique identifier for each questionnaire.}

\item{merge_col_name_est.intakes}{name of column to merge estimated food and 
nutrient intakes for food grams per day .csv file. Default is 'FFQ_ID'.}

\item{merge_col_name_nutr.intakes}{name of column to merge estimated food and 
nutrient intakes for nutrient .csv file. Default is 'FFQ_ID'.
the first column should be the unique identifier for each questionnaire.}

\item{perc}{proportion of distribution for each bin, float between 0 and 1 (default 0.2 for quintiles).}
}
\value{
A df containing the calculated DASH scores and estimated intakes of individual DASH components 
        using TwinsUK Standard groupings. 
        \describe{

}
\description{
The compute_twinsuk_dash function is a wrapper of calculate_dash to compute the 
DASH diet score using TwinsUK specific parameters and food groupings.
DASH computation as described by Fung et al. (2008).
TwinsUK specific FFQ line item & nutrient components as described by Pope et al. (2021).
